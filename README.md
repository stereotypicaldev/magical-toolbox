## ✨ Overview

**Magical Toolbox** brings together a set of powerful scripts designed for miscellaneous, everyday tasks — the kind that pop up during daily (or semi-daily) digital life. It’s the home of my personal arsenal of randomness, now organized and ready to be unleashed when needed.

### 🖼️ Visual Content Processing

The **Visual Content Processing** folder contains various specialized scripts for working with images in magical ways. Here's a glimpse of the spells you'll find:

   #### 🧙‍♂️ Deduplication

   Automatically detect and remove duplicate images from a folder of your choice.

   #### ⚡ Optimize File Size

   Shrink image file sizes using efficient optimization algorithms — perfect for saving disk space, speeding up websites, or sharing files more easily.

   #### 🌀 Randomize

   Rename images to randomized UUIDs — great for anonymizing or avoiding predictable file names.

   #### 🧹 Scrub Metadata

   Strip images of all metadata (EXIF, IPTC, etc.) to protect privacy and keep only the raw pixels.

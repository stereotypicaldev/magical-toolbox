## 📁 Categories

Dive into the enchanted realms of the **Magical Toolbox**, where each category offers a unique set of spells to simplify your digital life.

### 🖼️ Visual Content Processing

The **Visual Content Processing** folder is a treasure trove of specialized scripts designed to work wonders with your images. Prepare to be amazed by the spells at your fingertips:

* #### 🧙‍♂️ Deduplication

    Ever find your folders overflowing with identical images? Our **Deduplication** spell automatically detects and removes duplicates, decluttering your digital space with a flick of the wrist.

* #### ⚡ Optimize File Size

    Shrink your image file sizes with astonishing efficiency! Our **Optimize File Size** spell employs powerful algorithms, perfect for reclaiming disk space, accelerating website loading times, or making sharing a breeze.

* #### 🌀 Randomize

    Transform predictable filenames into a swirl of unique identifiers. The **Randomize** spell renames images to randomized UUIDs, ideal for anonymizing files or simply adding an element of surprise.

* #### 🧹 Scrub Metadata

    Protect your privacy with a powerful sweep! Our **Scrub Metadata** spell strips images of all embedded information (EXIF, IPTC, and more), leaving behind only the pure pixels you intend to share.
